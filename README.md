# Shared django codebase

This library contains shared resources, helper function and classes that are common amonst my django projects to ease development.

## Setup
To use this library in your project, You would need to add it to your project either by cloning this repo in your project or adding it as a [submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) (Let's say you have a fork and you'll need to keep updating)
